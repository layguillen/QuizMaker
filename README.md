Create a quiz maker program that reads a file of a quiz. 

Program prompts user for the file path ("Enter the fully qualified name of the file for the quiz: ").

Each line of the file is one question and it's possible answers, seperated by pipe-deliminators ("|"), with the correct answer signified by an asterisk. 

The program presents the first question and multiple-choice answers to the user. The user is allowed to select only one correct answer. 

The program outputs "Correct!" or "Incorrect." if the user selects the correct answer or an incorrect answer respectively. 

The next question and set of answers displays. 

The program continues until the end of the quiz input file. After the user selects their answer for the last question, the program outputs the users score.
